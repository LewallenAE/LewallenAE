## About Me

I'm Anthony Lewallen, a seasoned Senior Full-Stack AI Engineer with a passion for building scalable AI systems from the ground up. With over 3000+ hours dedicated to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), I've honed my expertise in fine-tuning AI models to deliver human-aligned, high-performance results. My background spans Python engineering, full-stack development, and cutting-edge AI innovations, enabling me to tackle complex problems in machine learning, natural language processing, and beyond.

I'm driven by the challenge of creating AI that not only works but excels in real-world applications. Whether it's architecting evaluation platforms or developing conversational AI from scratch, I thrive on turning ideas into impactful solutions.
