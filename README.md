## What I do
I build **production-grade AI evaluation and data-quality tooling**—the systems that make models and AI products reliable:
- dataset validation + anomaly detection
- evaluation harnesses + repeatable metrics
- APIs/CLIs + storage + CI gates
- performance-minded pipelines (batching, streaming, profiling)

I’ve logged **3,000+ hours** doing RLHF/evals work and I’m translating that experience into **engineered systems**.

## Featured Projects
## (In Progress)
### RLHF Data Quality System
A signal-based toolkit for auditing preference datasets (duplicates, formatting/pathologies, refusal bias, readability, etc.), designed with a “real pipeline” mindset: logs, tests, storage, and repeatable runs.
- **Signals framework** (extensible detectors)
- **SQLite results store** (initial prototyping)
- **PostgreSQL** (planned for production + long-term storage)
- **CLI + API surface**
- **CI-friendly**: intended to block bad data before training

## (In Progress)
### Ground-Zero-GPT (from-scratch GPT-style Transformer in PyTorch)
Tokenizer → embeddings → self-attention → training loop, with notes focused on internals (not API wrapping).
→ Repo: **https://github.com/LewallenAE/Ground-Zero-GPT**

---

## Tech I ship with
**Languages:** Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Java, SQL  
**ML/LLM:** PyTorch (transformers from scratch), Hugging Face (selective)  
**Agentic workflows:** LangGraph (selective)  
**Backend:** FastAPI, REST, auth patterns, background jobs  
**Data/Infra:** SQLite/Postgres, Docker, GitHub Actions  


---

## How I build
- Vertical slices over “big rewrites”
- Interfaces + invariants first (validation is not optional)
- Tests that prove behavior
- Logging/metrics as first-class citizens

## Open to
Applied Evals • EvalOps • Data Quality Engineering • Backend SWE • ML Systems (evaluation/reliability)
